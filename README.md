ExerciseCheck is a remote monitoring and evaluation platform for home base physical therapy.

## Requirements and Installation

Note: Because this application uses the Kinect V2, a Windows machine is necessary.
### MongoDB

Download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?#enterprise). Community Edition is enough for running the application. Make sure to add MongoDB to your PATH variables. 

### Kinect2

Download the driver from Microsoft: [Download Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44559).  
Make sure to follow the installation instructions on the website. 

### Nodejs

Nodejs should be installed. Run `npm install` under \anchor and \client directory in your local copy of this directory. 

## Running the Application

### Database set up
To run the application, first create a directory for mongoDB to store data. CD into the main electron-enabled-app directory and create a folder. Then use the command:
```
$ mongod --dbpath=[folder_name]\
```
### Run the server
To start the server, first cd into the \anchor directory. If this is your first time running the server, run the following command first to set up a root user for the application, which can be used to manage all other user accounts:  `$ node first-time-setup.js`. Then: 
```$ npm start```

### Run the electron application
To use the electron app, cd into the \client directory. Then:
 ```$ npm start```

## Development 
ExerciseCheck uses Anchor as its backend. To learn more about Anchor, click [here](https://github.com/hicsail/anchor). 

 - \anchor - directory holding most of the application's functionality.
     - \anchor\api - RESTful APIs
     - \anchor\models -  mongo database models
     - \anchor\web - handlebars templates, css, scripts, routes, etc.

- \client - directory for electron app & some Kinect-related functions
    - Note: It is possible to run ExerciseCheck in the browser by simply starting the Anchor server, however the Kinect will not work because the relevant code requires both Anchor and the Electron app.
